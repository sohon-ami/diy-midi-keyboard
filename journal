## Idea and Planning
- Concept: MIDI piano with drum pads and TFT showing chords/notes
- Estimated time: 2 hours

## Schematic Design
- Plan pin layout and switch matrix
- Estimated time: 3 hours

## PCB Layout
- Rough placement of keys, drum pads, DAC, TFT, and encoders
- Estimated time: 2 hours

## Firmware Planning
- Key matrix: `keypad` library
- Drum pads: integrated into matrix
- Rotary encoders: `rotaryio` library
- TFT: `displayio` library
- DAC: `audiobusio` library
- MIDI: `usb_midi` + `adafruit_midi` libraries
- Estimated time: 4 hours

## Next Steps
- Create rough schematic and PCB placeholder images
- Write initial placeholder code for matrix, TFT, and MIDI
